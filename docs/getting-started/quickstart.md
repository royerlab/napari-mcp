# Quick Start - 2 Minutes to AI-Controlled Napari

Get napari working with AI assistance in just 2 minutes. No manual server launch required.

!!! success "What You'll Accomplish"
    By the end of this guide:

    - ‚úÖ Claude Desktop (or your AI) starts napari server automatically
    - ‚úÖ Full control over a live napari viewer
    - ‚úÖ Ready to load images and take screenshots

## Step 1: Add MCP Server Entry (30 seconds)

1. Open Claude Desktop settings (‚åò+, on macOS; Ctrl+, on Windows/Linux)
2. Add this configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "napari": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": ["run", "--with", "napari-mcp", "napari-mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Save and fully restart Claude Desktop
4. Reference: [MCP JSON Configuration](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/mcp-json-configuration)

## Test the Connection (30 seconds)

Ask Claude Desktop:

!!! example "Test Commands"
    === "Basic Connection"
        ```
        Can you call session_information() to tell me about my napari session?
        ```

        **Expected response:** Information about your napari viewer including layers, camera settings, etc.

    === "Visual Test"
        ```
        Take a screenshot of my napari viewer
        ```

        **Expected response:** A PNG image of the napari window

    === "Interactive Test"
        ```
        Add some random sample data to napari and change the colormap to 'viridis'
        ```

## üéâ Success! What's Next?

If the tests above work, you're ready to explore:

### Immediate Things to Try

=== "Basic Operations"
    ```
    "Load an image from this path: /path/to/your/image.tif"
    "Create annotation points at coordinates [[100,100], [200,200]]"
    "Reset the view and zoom to 2x"
    "Switch to 3D display mode"
    ```

=== "Advanced Features"
    ```
    "Execute this code: print(f'Napari version: {napari.__version__}')"
    "Install scikit-image and create a filtered version of the current image"
    "Take a screenshot and describe what you see in the napari viewer"
    ```

=== "Analysis Workflows"
    ```
    "Create a synthetic image with Gaussian noise and add it to napari"
    "Apply different colormaps to compare visualization of the data"
    "Navigate through different time points if this is a time series"
    ```

## ‚ùå Common Issues

!!! failure "Claude can't see napari tools"
    **Solutions:**

    - Double-check the file path in your config is absolute
    - Restart Claude Desktop after making config changes
    - Verify the server is running (you should see terminal output)

!!! failure "uv: command not found"
    **Solution:** Install uv first:
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    # Restart your terminal
    ```

!!! failure "Napari window doesn't appear"
    **Solutions:**

    - Check if you're on a remote system (may need X11 forwarding)
    - Try setting: `export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` for headless mode
    - Verify Qt dependencies are available

## Optional: Napari Plugin Bridge (External Viewer)

Prefer controlling an existing napari window?

1. `pip install napari-mcp`
2. Open napari ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí MCP Server Control
3. Click ‚ÄúStart Server‚Äù (default port 9999)
4. Keep the same MCP JSON config from Step 1; the server will auto-detect and proxy to this external viewer
