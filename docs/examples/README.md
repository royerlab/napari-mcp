# Python Integration Examples

Working examples demonstrating how to use napari MCP server in custom Python scripts for workflow automation.

## üìÅ Available Examples

### 1. OpenAI Integration (`openai_integration.py`)

**Description:** Use OpenAI GPT-4 with napari MCP server for AI-controlled image analysis.

**Use case:** Automated workflows where GPT-4 decides which napari operations to perform.

**Run:**
```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Run with installed packages
python openai_integration.py

# Or with uv (zero-install)
uv run --with openai --with mcp python openai_integration.py
```

**What it does:**
- Connects OpenAI GPT-4 to napari MCP server
- Lists available napari tools
- Uses GPT-4 to generate code for creating test images
- Executes the code in napari environment

### 2. Anthropic Claude Integration (`anthropic_integration.py`)

**Description:** Use Anthropic Claude with napari MCP server for intelligent microscopy analysis.

**Use case:** Automated workflows with Claude's advanced reasoning capabilities.

**Run:**
```bash
# Set your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Run with installed packages
python anthropic_integration.py

# Or with uv (zero-install)
uv run --with anthropic --with mcp python anthropic_integration.py
```

**What it does:**
- Connects Claude 3.5 Sonnet to napari MCP server
- Converts napari tools to Claude format
- Asks Claude to take a screenshot
- Executes napari tools based on Claude's decisions

---

### 3. Direct MCP Client (`direct_mcp_client.py`)

**Description:** Direct napari MCP automation without external LLMs.

**Use case:** Scripted workflows, batch processing, automated testing.

**Run:**
```bash
# No API key needed!
python direct_mcp_client.py

# Or with uv
uv run --with mcp python direct_mcp_client.py
```

**What it does:**
- Creates synthetic test data in napari
- Lists all layers
- Takes a screenshot
- Gets session information
- All without any external AI - pure automation
